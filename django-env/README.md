# Django Project

This repository contains source codes to create a Full-Featured Django application. Majority of the materials are from Corey Schafer's tutorial series that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc.

While completing the tutorial, I also took notes and code-snippets on emacs using Org Mode. Afterwards I exported the .org file into .html and the HTML file can also be found in this project.

This project is uploaded online and publicly available for future referencing.

The .html file is readable on all browsers. Although the file can be stored offline, network connection is needed for CSS stylesheets.

# Note

The database file has been excluded from this online repo.
